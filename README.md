# MyGCSE-Maths

_MyGCSEMaths_ is a virtual learning system aimed at GCSE Maths students. This was a system I created in 2014 as part of my Computing Unit 4 Project for my sixth form college. If you're interested in viewing more detailed information about the system, please take a look at the Documentation folder.

#Login panel
In the login panel, users(Admin, Teacher and Student) could login to use the application. They will therefore be redirected to the correct form depending on their system rank upon successful authentication.

On the admin page, the amin can add new users(student, teacher or admin). If the user is a student or teacher, the admin can then assign them to an already existing class. The admin can also search for all users in the system and edit their credentials as shown in the screenshot below.

In the teacher panel, the teacher can do an array of things. The first page they're shown is the search page, where they can view all or search for specific students. From there, they can select a student and view their progress on the tasks they've completed. An example is as shown below.<br>

Other things the teacher can do includes

 - View student's progress 
 - Use the question generator form to have the system generate questions
 - Manually view, add, edit and delete questions 
 - Create quizzes 
 - Export answers for specific quizzes or range questions
 - Export students progress data
